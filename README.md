Hello world, I focus on contributing and/or creating full stack web development solutions that hopefully have a significant people impact. I am devoted to ongoing education and the sharing of information in technology. 

Naturally i look to collaborate on meaningful project opportunities, as well as the discussion of the latest advances in internet infrastructure, web research, and production level code advancements.
