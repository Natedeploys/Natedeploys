I am a Full Stack Web developer based in Switzerland and co-creator of Dev Isle. I really enjoy developing web applications, helping others and continue to learn by practicing new and harder tasks everyday, at the moment, i'm building performant applications focusing on React, Node, Websockets, NoSQL with CI / CD.


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Dev Isle and well the rest is secret :) ...
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Websockets, Scaling, Electron and Redis.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Open Source and tutorials at Dev Isle.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Slate JS, if you are a guru, feel free to reach out!
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about React, Node, GraphQL, Mongo, Microservices.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can cook a mighty Schnitzel
