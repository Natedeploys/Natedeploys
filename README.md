Hello world, I focus on contributing and/or creating solutions that hopefully have a significant people impact. I am devoted to ongoing education and the sharing of information in technology. 

Naturally, I look to collaborate on meaningful project opportunities, as well as discuss the latest advancements in internet infrastructure, web research, and production level code.
