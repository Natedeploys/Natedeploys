Hello world, I focus on contributing or creating full stack web development solutions that hopefully have a significant people impact. I am devoted to ongoing educatio and the sharing of information in technology. 

Naturally i look for meaningful project opportunities, cooperation and mentorship as well as the exploration of advances in infrastructure, research, and production code.
