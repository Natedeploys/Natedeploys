Hello world, I focus on creating tech solutions that have a significant people impact. Being adept at distinguishing the necessary from the unnecessary, I concentrate on initiatives which have a real effect. Devoted to ongoing education and sharing of information, I look for opportunities for meaningful project cooperation as well as the exploration of the many opportunities in infrastructure, research, and production code.
