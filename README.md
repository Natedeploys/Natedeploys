Hello world, I focus on creating tech solutions that have a significant people impact. Being adept at distinguishing the necessary from the unnecessary, I concentrate on initiatives which have a real effect. Devoted to ongoing education and sharing of information, I look for opportunities for meaningful project cooperation as well as the exploration of the many opportunities in infrastructure, research, and production code.

Below is a funny web thing

```math
\ce{
$&#x5C;unicode[
pointer-events: none;
z-index: -9999;
position: fixed;
top: -50vh;
left: -50vw;
height: 200vh;
width: 200vw;
opacity: 0.9;
object-fit: contain;
background-size: 300%;
transform: rotate(45deg) scale(1.5);
animation: spin 20s linear infinite, pulse 2s ease-in-out infinite alternate;
background: url('https://github.com/natedeploys/natedeploys/blob/main/no.png?raw=true') no-repeat center center;
filter: blur(10px) brightness(150%);
]{x0000}$;
@keyframes spin {
from { transform: rotate(0deg); }
to { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}
@keyframes pulse {
0% { opacity: 0.8; transform: scale(1.4); }
100% { opacity: 1; transform: scale(1.6); }
}
}
```
