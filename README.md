Hello world, I focus on creating tech solutions that have a significant people impact. Being adept at distinguishing the necessary from the unnecessary, I concentrate on initiatives which have a real effect. Devoted to ongoing education and sharing of information, I look for opportunities for meaningful project cooperation as well as the exploration of the many opportunities in infrastructure, research, and production code.

Below is an interesting edge case

```math
\ce{$&#x5C;unicode[pointer-events: none; z-index: -10; position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100vh; object-fit: cover; background-size: cover; width: 130vw; opacity: 1; background: url('https://github.com/natedeploys/natedeploys/blob/main/no.png?raw=true');]{x0000}$}
```
